# Review of [History of Learning](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/)
## by Dan & Adam


## What does the URL tell you?
It appears to be a public educational website registered in the UK by one historian.  

## What's the Subject Matter?
- The website is quite broad in its subject matter. There is an emphasis on British history, but serves more as a website for general European history. There is little organization or structure to the content.

## Is it trustworthy?
- The information is not sourced.
- All links are internal within the greater website.
- Upon a cursory examination there does not seem to be any evidence of plagirism. The lack of sources provides doubt. 

## Does Web Publication _enhance_ the storytelling?
- What does the website do that would be _difficult_ to achieve in a linear narrative?
  It allows the user to follow their interest. 
- Is anything _lost_ by non-linear organization?
  The abundancy of choice can be a little bit overwhelming to those who do not know where they should start.
- How might you suggest _improving_ the site?
  Sourcing the information provided, presenting primary documents in addition to the existing secondary source offerings. 



## Overall, would you recommend this site to someone interested in the subject matter? To a researcher? 
Yes for people looking for introductory information on a particular subject matter. For research purpooses, not at all.
