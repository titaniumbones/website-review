# Review of [the Lost Museum](http://lostmuseum.cuny.edu)
## by Alexandra


## What does the URL tell you?
The Lost Museum is a product of CUNY, the City University of New York. According to the About section, this was a collaborative effort at the New Media Lab at the CUNY Graduate Center between 1996 and 2002. It was created by the American Social History Project.

## What's the Subject Matter?
The Lost Museum website is a recreation of P.T. Barnumâ€™s American Museum as a lens into mid-19th century New York City and antebellum America

## Is it trustworthy?
Sources and historical materials are documented, although not linked specifically in the recreation of the American Museum itself. Background essays are provided with further information.

## Does Web Publication _enhance_ the storytelling?
This is an immersive, interactive experience that engages the visitor in the story, and appears to be specifically targeted towards primary school students. Navigation is difficult at times, which is mostly a product of when the site was created.

## Overall, would you recommend this site to someone interested in the subject matter? To a researcher? 
The site is intended as a teaching source relevant to topics commonly taught in U.S. history in school. I would not, however, recommend it to a researcher.
