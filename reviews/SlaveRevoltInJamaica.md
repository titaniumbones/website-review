# Review of [Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760-61](http://revolt.axismaps.com/project.html)
## by Nathaniel Thomas


## What does the URL tell you?

The top domain (axismaps.com) initally suggest a personal website devoted to maps of Axis powers in World War II. However, axismaps.com seems to be a business located in Texas dedicated to building maps. Vincent Brown, the creator of the *Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760-61* pages, seems to have been a client in 2012, based on the [Acknowledgements](http://revolt.axismaps.com/acknowledgments.html). Vincent Brown ([Wikipedia bio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Brown_%28historian%29)) is a historian at Harvard University.

## What's the Subject Matter?

- Mapping the revolt of Black slaves in Jamaica in 1760-61

## Is it trustworthy?

- The sources are documented, including in a number of footnotes in the main article and in the Bibliography.
- The sources seem to be entirely Print.
- There is no evidence of plagiarism.

## Does Web Publication _enhance_ the storytelling?

- What does the website do that would be _difficult_ to achieve in a linear narrative?

The website is generally linear, but providing geographic information for wars, rebellions, journeys, and trade routes (for example) clarifies one of the most confusing part of those narratives.

- Is anything _lost_ by non-linear organization?

Being relatively linear, this question isn't particularly applicable, but one can go over particularly confusing moments in the chronology.

- How might you suggest _improving_ the site?

Making it more non-linear and preventing linkrot (for example, the [Blog link](http://revolt.axismaps.com/blog/) is dead).

## Overall, would you recommend this site to someone interested in the subject matter? To a researcher? 

Yes, to both.
